# CRUK C.I. R Shiny Workshop
## Wednesday 13th September: 13:00 - 17:00

The [Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) R package facilates the building of web applications without the need to learn Javascript, CSS or HTML. All you need is your existing R skills and a few extra commands.

The Bioinformatics Core have used Shiny to good effect to make some published datasets accessible, support the teaching of statistics, and even produce a live-demo for the Science Festival. In this workshop we will cover the basics of developing a Shiny application and turning your existing analyses into web applications. 

After the workshop you should be able to create a simple web app to subset and plot the results of a typical high-throughput study. We will also offer some hints and tips about how you can make your apps more memory-efficient and incorporate interactive graphics.

We will assume some experience with R, such as being able to subset data frames and produce graphics in base R.
